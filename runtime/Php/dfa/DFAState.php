// A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
// As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
// to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
// reading each input symbol. That is to say, after reading
// input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
// subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
// ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
// In conventional NFA&rarr;DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
// would be a bitset representing the set of states the
// ATN could be in. We need to track the alt predicted by each
// state as well, however. More importantly, we need to maintain
// a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
// jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
// I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
// the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
//
// <p>I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states. An ATNConfig
// is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
// the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.</p>
//
// <p>A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
// but with different ATN contexts (with same or different alts)
// meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.</p>
